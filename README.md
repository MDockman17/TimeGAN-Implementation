# TimeGAN Implementation
We implement TimeGAN for five large-cap stocks. TimeGAN consists of four neural networks: an embedder network to create a low-dimensional representation that learns relationships among features, a generator to create synthetic data, a discriminator to identify the true and fake data, and a recovery network to map the low-dimensional representation back to the ambient space. To aid in learning the temporal structure of the data, the true data is periodically used to perform supervised learning at each time step. The four networks are trained jointly using the traditional mini-max game, the reconstruction loss, and the aforementioned supervised loss. We show here that with limited data, we are unable to recreate all of the properties present in stock returns such as linear unpredictability, fat tails, and volatility clustering.
